## Luminovo Rust Challenge
Welcome to Luminovo's Rust Challenge! It's a series of 3 small exercises that will help
 you get a feeling for the kind of work we do at Luminovo, and what engineering tasks
  you would likely face day-to-day.

In this repo we use two major rust libraries, the docs for which you might find
 useful:
 * [diesel](https://docs.diesel.rs/master/diesel/index.html), which also has useful guides [here](https://diesel.rs/guides/)
 * [actix](https://actix.rs/docs/)

You can solve these challenges independently, but to get a full understanding of the context we recommend that you read the READMEs for each challenge in order. At times you might find the description a little vague, and think that you need some additional assumptions or context. We are happy for you to make those assumptions as long as they you mention them somewhere in a comment. If you get stuck you can also skip a challenge and go to the next one.

Have fun! :)

## Challenge 1:
Go to [src/search](src/search)

## Challenge 2:
Go to [src/db](src/db)

## Challenge 3:
Go to [src/routes](src/routes)

## Note on gitpod setup
If you are using Gitpod then you should have everything preinstalled already and you can jump straight into coding. Note that building and/or pulling the image might take around 10 minutes. You should have:
* cargo and rust fmt
* Postgres database
* diesel and diesel_cli
* VS code Rust pluging providing autocomplete and syntax highlighting
